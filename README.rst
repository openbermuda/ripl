This is a place for simple utilities that do something.

They should eventually end up in other projects.

Some of these are simple translators.  I am sure many already exist.

Until it gets complicated, I will stick with these.

Only a subset of the full markups will be supported, but I think I can
live within those.

I am interested in two way conversions, that do not lose information.

Transformations which lose data are interesting too.

TODO
====

rest2py and py2rest

mark2rest and rest2mark

rest2json and json2rest

py2json and json2py.  these are done coutesy of import json.

Chaining converstions and examining information loss.

stories/talk.rst this is markdown not rest .. hmm

Spares: would be good to embed them below captions.  The blank white
slides don't really work.

Multi-line captions?

Start slide.  Would be good to have one.

Need to truncate captions from filenames.  Just take filename without
the suffix or folder path.

Need to deal with rotation problems on some images - deep joy.
