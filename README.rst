This is a place for simple utilities that do something.

They should eventually end up in other projects.

Some of these are simple translators.  I am sure many already exist.

Until it gets complicated, I will stick with these.

Only a subset of the full markups will be supported, but I think I can
live within those.

I am interested in two way conversions, that do not lose information.

Transformations which lose data are interesting too.

TODO
====

rest2py and py2rest

mark2rest and rest2mark

rest2json and json2rest

Chaining converstions and examining information loss.
